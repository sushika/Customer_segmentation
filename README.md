## 🛠️ Key Steps Taken  

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed **customer transaction and demographic data**.  
- ✅ Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and performed categorical encoding.  

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering  
- ✅ Extracted key customer attributes like **purchase frequency, average spending, and engagement level**.  
- ✅ Created new features based on behavioral segmentation.  

### 3️⃣ Model Selection & Training  
- ✅ Implemented **multi-class classification models** to segment customers.  
- ✅ Used **clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) and supervised learning methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks)** for segmentation.  
- ✅ Compared models using **F1-score, accuracy, and silhouette scores**.  

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation & Insights  
- 📌 The best-performing model was selected based on **prediction accuracy and segmentation consistency**.  
- 📌 Customers were classified into distinct groups based on **spending habits, purchasing behavior, and engagement levels**.  
- 📌 Findings help businesses identify **high-value customers, potential churners, and budget-conscious buyers**.  

### 💡 Business Impact  
- 🎯 **Targeted Marketing** – Personalized recommendations and tailored promotions for different customer groups.  
- 💰 **Revenue Growth** – Focused strategies for high-value customers to increase loyalty and spending.  
- 🔄 **Customer Retention** – Identifying at-risk customers and implementing retention strategies.
